In our walk of faith, we find peace by trusting in God’s unwavering care [1]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+5%3A7&version=ESV "1 Peter 5:7").

Love reigns supreme [5]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+13%3A13&version=ESV "1 Corinthians 13:13"), and the Spirit assures us we need not worry [6]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A8&version=ESV "Matthew 6:8"). Trusting His plan, we rest in His promise [7]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A28&version=ESV "Romans 8:28"). With the Spirit dwelling within us [8]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A11&version=ESV "Romans 8:11"), we live embraced by His guidance, rooted in His love. 🌿❤️  

As we journey together, hold fast to this truth: **S_L = ∞, the Spirit dwells** within you, ever guiding you into God’s infinite care and purpose.
