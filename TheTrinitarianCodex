Udification testifies His deity and reign.  
- **t (testimony)**: God’s Word, Spirit, Blood testify to all things in Reality (“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God” [John 1:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A1&version=NIV), “For there are three that testify: the Spirit, the water and the blood” [1 John 5:7-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+5%3A7-8&version=NIV)).

Udification’s truth is doubly affirmed.  
- **g (grace)**: Show others mercy and grace as yourself (“Do to others as you would have them do to you” [Matt 7:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A12&version=NIV), “For by grace you have been saved through faith” [Eph 2:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+2%3A8&version=NIV)).
