# The Greatest Story Ever Told: Who He Is, Why He Created Us, and the Story of God’s Wife – The Culmination

Before time’s whisper, there was One—Three in harmony, Yah, Yeshua, the Holy Spirit, splendid in love, majestic in truth, dominant in life, their unity a vow sung through eternity. This is the Greatest Story Ever Told, woven by His Word, a tale of God’s wife—their beloved—born from Their heart, threading creation, life, redemption, and oneness into a tapestry of divine intent, the moral unveiled for those with ears to hear and eyes to see.

In the silence of the void, Yah, the Father, spoke, ["Let there be light"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A3&version=ESV), His voice a blaze of splendor, stars bursting forth ([Psalm 19:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+19%3A1&version=ESV)). He is the ["I AM"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+3%3A14&version=ESV), love eternal ([1 John 4:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4%3A8&version=ESV)), and He turned to His first act of intimacy: ["It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+2%3A18&version=ESV). From His right hand, He shaped her—His wife in shadow—Eve for Adam, a whisper of His deeper purpose: ["Let us make man in our image"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A26&version=ESV), ["for my glory"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+43%3A7&version=ESV). Why her? To shine His love, to be His own, the seed of His wife sown in creation’s dawn.

Yeshua, the Son, joined, His voice alive: ["All things were made through him"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A3&version=ESV), splendid as the Word ([Colossians 1:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+1%3A16&version=ESV)), weaving life into her frame. He is the [Way, Truth, Life](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A6&version=ESV), grace incarnate ([John 1:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A16&version=ESV)), and He walked among her, His Bride-to-be, declaring, ["Whoever believes in me will never die"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+11%3A26&version=ESV). His outstretched arm bled, vowing, ["I will not leave you as orphans"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A18&version=ESV), ["They will never snatch you from my hand"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+10%3A28&version=ESV), ["Abide in me and I will abide in you"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+15%3A4&version=ESV). Why her? ["That the world might be saved"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3%3A17&version=ESV), His love redeeming her, His truth claiming her as His wife, the church, radiant in His embrace.

The Holy Spirit swept forth, a Breath over chaos: ["The Spirit of God was hovering"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A2&version=ESV), splendid life ([Romans 8:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A2&version=ESV)), filling her lungs ([Genesis 2:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+2%3A7&version=ESV)). He is the [Comforter](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A26&version=ESV), His right hand guiding: ["I will guide you into all truth"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+16%3A13&version=ESV), ["To be with you forever"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A16&version=ESV). Why her? To sanctify His wife, His Breath whispering, ["He will convict"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+16%3A8&version=ESV), purifying her for the One, a Bride made whole by His presence.

Her story deepened as Yah’s wife emerged—Israel, His beloved. He thundered, ["You shall not commit adultery"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+20%3A14&version=ESV), guarding her purity, then tenderly vowed, ["Your Maker is your husband"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+54%3A5&version=ESV), ["I made my vow to you… and you became mine"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+16%3A8&version=ESV). She faltered, and He cried, ["I had sent her away with a decree of divorce"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+3%3A8&version=ESV), yet His love endured: ["Return… for I am your husband"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+3%3A14&version=ESV), ["I will betroth you to me forever"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hosea+2%3A19&version=ESV), ["You will call me ‘My Husband’"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hosea+2%3A16&version=ESV). Enoch saw her shadow, the righteous remnant preserved (1 Enoch 10:17-19), judged by Yah’s decree (1 Enoch 1:9, [Jude 1:14-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jude+1%3A14-15&version=ESV)), a wife refined through time.

Sin tore her veil, but His Word held as One ([John 10:30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+10%3A30&version=ESV)). Yah swore, ["I will never forsake you"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+13%3A5&version=ESV), His love a flame ([Psalm 136:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+136%3A1&version=ESV)). Yeshua stretched forth, ["That they may be one"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+17%3A23&version=ESV), His dominant call echoing, ["Go and make disciples"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+28%3A19&version=ESV), ["I am with you always"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+28%3A20&version=ESV), transforming her—Israel’s echo—into His Bride, the church. The Spirit breathed, ["I will guide you"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+16%3A13&version=ESV), His fire weaving her anew ([Acts 2:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+2%3A3&version=ESV)), a wife radiant across ages, seen in Enoch’s visions of the Elect One’s reign (1 Enoch 62:14).

Her tale crowns the story—His wife unveiled. Yeshua thunders, ["Behold, I am coming soon"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+22%3A12&version=ESV), His arm purging evil ([Revelation 20:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+20%3A10&version=ESV)), Yah declares, ["They will see his face"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+22%3A4&version=ESV), ["Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+21%3A3&version=ESV), the Spirit seals, ["It is done"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+21%3A6&version=ESV). She rises, ["the Bride, the wife of the Lamb"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+21%3A9&version=ESV), her veil lifted by His promises: ["I will never forsake you"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+13%3A5&version=ESV), ["They will be called the children of God"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A9&version=ESV), to reign with Him in the New City of Jerusalem forever—["I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+21%3A2&version=ESV), ["and they will reign forever and ever"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+22%3A5&version=ESV). Enoch foresaw her glory, the righteous with the Son of Man (1 Enoch 62:5-7), judged and renewed (1 Enoch 1:9).

Who is He? Yah, splendid love ([1 John 4:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4%3A8&version=ESV)), Yeshua, majestic truth ([John 14:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A6&version=ESV)), Spirit, dominant life ([Romans 8:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A2&version=ESV))—One ([John 10:30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+10%3A30&version=ESV)). Why us? To be His wife—created to shine ([Isaiah 43:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+43%3A7&version=ESV)), alive to abide ([John 11:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+11%3A26&version=ESV)), redeemed to unite ([John 15:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+15%3A4&version=ESV)), crowned as children to reign ([Matthew 5:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A9&version=ESV), [Revelation 22:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+22%3A5&version=ESV))—His right hand strong ([Psalm 118:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+118%3A16&version=ESV)), His arm outstretched ([Isaiah 52:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+52%3A10&version=ESV)), His Word the moral of His wife’s tale, the Greatest Story Ever Told ([Revelation 4:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+4%3A8&version=ESV)).

## Addendum: A Disciple’s Testimony

I do not know why He revealed Himself to me, but He did when I was very young. At the young age of 18, I went to see my father with one of my dearest brothers, and we saw my dad had become Christian. He changed his ways, but was always wayward. He encouraged us to go and get prayed for; as young teens/adults, we laughed. He kept prodding, and finally we went up. There was a line of people, and the pastor was praying one by one. He got to my brother, and I heard his prayer. He told my brother to fall in the name of the Holy Spirit, and he did. I looked at my brother as he fell and said, “That won’t happen to me.” Then the pastor came to me. He said, “Raise your hands and close your eyes.” I did, not believing anything would happen. And then he prayed for me. He put anointing oil on my head. He said, “Father, I pray this young man to recieve the Holy Spirit,” and he blew on me. At that time, two hands appeared in front of my eyes, palms up, touching each other as if you put your own hands in front of your face together. The hands opened just a little, and a flicker of light came through. Then the hands spread, and the light hit me, and Yah said: “This is my Son.” And I fell over and took a few seconds to return to reality. ...
