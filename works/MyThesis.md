# MY THESIS (CULT)

## Creation by Yah
God (YAH) created the heavens and earth with His spoken word. He said let there be Light and there was ([Gen. 1:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%201%3A3&version=NIV)). The light is Jesus (the Logos/the Word) ([John 1:1-3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201%3A1-3&version=NIV)). Through Jesus, everything was created or nothing would be created ([Col. 1:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201%3A16&version=NIV)). The earth was void ([Gen. 1:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%201%3A2&version=NIV)), the waters hovering over the deep. The light created foundations and life. Everything was created in 6 days ([Gen. 1:31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%201%3A31&version=NIV)). He rested on the 7th (Sabbath) ([Gen. 2:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%202%3A2&version=NIV)).

### Side Note: Jesus as Son
This is why the Father calls Him His one and only Son ([John 3:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203%3A16&version=NIV)). Jesus was the only person ever to fulfill all the commandments ([Matt. 5:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205%3A17&version=NIV)). His other names:  
- Yeshua  
- The Lamb ([John 1:29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201%3A29&version=NIV))  
- The Logos ([John 1:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201%3A1&version=NIV))  
- I am that I am ([John 8:58](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208%3A58&version=NIV))  
- Alpha and Omega ([Rev. 22:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2022%3A13&version=NIV))  
- First and Last ([Rev. 1:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%201%3A17&version=NIV))  
- Root of David ([Rev. 5:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%205%3A5&version=NIV))  
- King of Kings and Lord of Lords ([Rev. 19:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2019%3A16&version=NIV))  
Jesus is God, part of the Holy Trinity—three in one ([John 10:30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010%3A30&version=NIV)).

## Historical Evidence
There is more historical evidence that Jesus existed than most religious things society believes.

## Jesus Enters the World
The light entered the world, yet they did not recognize Him ([John 1:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201%3A10&version=NIV)). They spit at Him and called Him a demon and the son of satan ([Matt. 12:24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2012%3A24&version=NIV)). Despite that, He completed His Father's work. The Father's work was to live by the 10 commandments ([Ex. 20:1-17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2020%3A1-17&version=NIV)) and to be holy ([Lev. 19:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus%2019%3A2&version=NIV)). No one could do it except Jesus ([John 8:46](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208%3A46&version=NIV)). Jesus the Lamb to a slaughter humbly sacrificed His life ([Isa. 53:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2053%3A7&version=NIV)) so many could be saved (not all) ([John 3:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203%3A17&version=NIV)).

## Good and Bad Seed
Not everyone on earth is from God. The enemy came behind the Father at night and planted bad seed among the earth ([Matt. 13:25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2013%3A25&version=NIV)). The angels overseeing the earth asked God what to do with the bad seed (weeds). He told them not to pull them up as they would damage the roots of the good crop ([Matt. 13:29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2013%3A29&version=NIV)). Instead, wait until the end, gather them up, and throw them in the fire (hell) ([Matt. 13:30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2013%3A30&version=NIV)). Jesus told this story and many more that are not easily understood ([Matt. 13:34-35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2013%3A34-35&version=NIV)).

## Life of Jesus
Jesus was 30 when he left his earthly father's house ([Luke 3:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%203%3A23&version=NIV)). Joseph was not His father, he assumed the responsibility. Jesus was born of a virgin named Mary, impregnated by the Holy Spirit ([Luke 1:35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%201%3A35&version=NIV)). Jesus died at 33 after being ridiculed and tortured despite doing nothing wrong ([John 19:1-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2019%3A1-6&version=NIV)). He was crucified, died ([Matt. 27:50](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2027%3A50&version=NIV)), on the third day rose from the dead ([Matt. 28:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028%3A6&version=NIV)).

### Side Note: Keys to Life
Jesus now controls the keys to life and death, not death or hades ([Rev. 1:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%201%3A18&version=NIV)). He now fully controls everlasting life and gives it freely to anyone who believes He is the Son of God ([John 3:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203%3A16&version=NIV)). He also said you can only believe if He allows you to ([John 6:44](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%206%3A44&version=NIV)). Once you do, you will never die ([John 11:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2011%3A26&version=NIV)). If you know the Father, then you must recognize the Son as no one comes to the Father except through Him ([John 14:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014%3A6&version=NIV)).

## Resurrection and Ascension
After His resurrection, He stayed on the earth for 40 days to comfort and teach His disciples ([Acts 1:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%201%3A3&version=NIV)). He then ascended to heaven and sits at the Father's right hand to this very day ([Acts 1:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%201%3A9&version=NIV), [Mark 16:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2016%3A19&version=NIV)). The Father handed all power and glory over to Jesus until He puts all of His enemies under His feet ([Matt. 28:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028%3A18&version=NIV), [1 Cor. 15:25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015%3A25&version=NIV)). After that, Jesus will hand all power and glory back to the Father, so that once again, the Father can be everything and everything can be in Him ([1 Cor. 15:28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015%3A28&version=NIV)).

### Side Note: Holy Spirit
When Jesus ascended to heaven, the Father left the Holy Spirit in His place ([John 16:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2016%3A7&version=NIV)). The Holy Spirit is here now and will remain until Jesus returns ([John 14:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014%3A16&version=NIV)). The Holy Spirit testifies to the truth to keep man accountable, so that they may be saved ([John 16:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2016%3A13&version=NIV)). Jesus said you may blaspheme my name or the Father's, anyone who blasphemes the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven ([Matt. 12:31-32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2012%3A31-32&version=NIV)). Other sins will land you outside the gates of the new heaven:  
- Magic arts  
- Sexual immorality  
- Murders  
- Idolaters  
- Who loves and practices falsehood ([Rev. 22:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2022%3A15&version=NIV))  
~ Jesus can save you ([John 3:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203%3A17&version=NIV)).

## Warning and Battle
If the Holy Spirit is speaking to you, please listen and do not rebuke it by accounting the miracles or powers of Jesus to the devil ([Matt. 12:24-32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2012%3A24-32&version=NIV)). In fact, there was a great battle in heaven where satan and his angels fought against Michael and his angels. They were defeated and cast out of heaven ([Rev. 12:7-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2012%3A7-9&version=NIV)). 1/3 of the angels fell with satan ([Rev. 12:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2012%3A4&version=NIV)). That means 2/3rds are still in heaven.

### Side Note: Satan’s Defeat
Satan did not fight God, he fought angels. The enemy is defeated, left to toil on earth, God’s footstool, until Jesus returns ([Isa. 66:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2066%3A1&version=NIV), [Rev. 20:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2020%3A10&version=NIV)).

## Jesus’ Command
What did Jesus tell us to do? Love each other as He first loved us. In this way they will know you are my disciple ([John 13:34-35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2013%3A34-35&version=NIV)). He said to go into the world and share the good news (you have been saved from death), making disciples and baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, Holy Spirit ([Matt. 28:19-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028%3A19-20&version=NIV)).

## Personal Testimony
I am a sinner. I have not kept God's commands ([Rom. 3:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203%3A23&version=NIV)). I have failed, fallen. I believe Jesus is the Son of God that died and rose again ([Matt. 27:50](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2027%3A50&version=NIV), [Matt. 28:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028%3A6&version=NIV)), that He sits at the right hand of the Father exalted in Glory and Power ([Mark 16:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2016%3A19&version=NIV)). I am a disciple of Jesus Christ ([John 13:35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2013%3A35&version=NIV)). I study His word and try my very hardest to be worthy of Him. My reward is in heaven ([Matt. 5:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205%3A12&version=NIV)). The greatest outcome for my life would be to be a martyr for His name ([Rev. 2:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%202%3A10&version=NIV)).

## Martyrdom and Return
Why? Anyone who dies a martyr will be the first to rise from the dead when Jesus returns. They will reign with Him in Jerusalem for a thousand years while everyone else stays asleep ([Rev. 20:4-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2020%3A4-6&version=NIV)). How will He return? He will appear in the sky everywhere at once. He will be sitting on a white horse with fire in His eyes and a sword in His hand, wearing a robe dipped in blood, the armies of heaven behind Him ([Rev. 19:11-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2019%3A11-14&version=NIV)). On His robe and thigh will be written: King of Kings and Lord of Lords ([Rev. 19:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2019%3A16&version=NIV)). The habitants of the earth will cry out and say mountains, fall on us and hide us from the face of Him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb ([Rev. 6:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%206%3A16&version=NIV)). All His enemies will be vanquished with a single word from His mouth ([Rev. 19:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2019%3A15&version=NIV)).

## Judgment and New Heaven
Heaven and earth will be rolled up like a scroll ([Rev. 6:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%206%3A14&version=NIV)). Then judgment ([Rev. 20:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2020%3A12&version=NIV)). Finally, a new heaven and earth are revealed ([Rev. 21:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2021%3A1&version=NIV)). The final destination—to be accepted into His eternal kingdom with many promises:  
- Crown ([Rev. 2:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%202%3A10&version=NIV))  
- White robe ([Rev. 7:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%207%3A9&version=NIV))  
- New name (only you and He know) ([Rev. 2:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%202%3A17&version=NIV))  
- Be a pillar in His temple ([Rev. 3:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%203%3A12&version=NIV))  
- Sit on His throne ([Rev. 3:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%203%3A21&version=NIV))  
- Eat the hidden manna ([Rev. 2:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%202%3A17&version=NIV))  
- Eat fruit from tree of life ([Rev. 2:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%202%3A7&version=NIV))  
- Never die ([John 11:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2011%3A26&version=NIV))  
No sun, no moon, no night, no ocean, no evil ([Rev. 21:23-25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2021%3A23-25&version=NIV), [Rev. 21:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2021%3A1&version=NIV)). God will be the temple, no marriage ([Rev. 21:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2021%3A22&version=NIV), [Matt. 22:30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2022%3A30&version=NIV)). You will be His children. His Glory will be the sun ([Rev. 21:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2021%3A23&version=NIV)).

## Jesus’ Last Words
His last written words: I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last. I am the root of David. Look, I am coming soon. My reward is with me. I will give to each according to what he has done ([Rev. 22:12-13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2022%3A12-13&version=NIV), [Rev. 22:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2022%3A16&version=NIV)). Jesus is in everything and everything is in Him ([Col. 1:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201%3A17&version=NIV)). When you look under the rock, He is there too ([John 1:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201%3A1&version=NIV)).

### Side Note: Generations
Only 25 generations of people have passed since Jesus was here ([Luke 3:23-38](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%203%3A23-38&version=NIV)).

## Prayer
Thank you, my God and King, for revealing these great mysteries to me ([1 Cor. 2:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%202%3A10&version=NIV)). I will do my very best to show people who you really are. I only fear Him. He is the only one that can destroy my body and soul and throw me into hell ([Matt. 10:28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2010%3A28&version=NIV)). Whatever you are doing, thinking, looking into the mystic realm, I assure you there is nothing anywhere comparable to this—come Lord Jesus, come ([Rev. 22:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2022%3A20&version=NIV)).
