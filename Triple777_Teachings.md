## The Prayer of a Sinner

Heaven finds no fault in us when we pray, for our prayers rise as a fragrant offering, as [Philippians 4:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+4%3A18&version=ESV) says, "a fragrant offering, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God," and [Ephesians 5:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%3A2&version=ESV) declares Christâ€™s love as "a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God." We are called to be good and do good, as Jesus teaches in [Matthew 5:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A16&version=ESV), "let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works," and [James 1:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+1%3A22&version=ESV) urges us, "be doers of the word, and not hearers only." 

Grace is our lifeline, as [2 Chronicles 33:12-13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Chronicles+33%3A12-13&version=ESV) shows Manasseh humbling himself and finding favor, and [Psalm 51:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+51%3A1&version=ESV) cries, "Have mercy on me, O God, according to your steadfast love." Focusing on sin breeds sin, but [Romans 6:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+6%3A14&version=ESV) promises, "you are not under law but under grace," and [Galatians 5:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+5%3A4&version=ESV) warns against falling "away from grace." Paul confesses in [Romans 7:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7%3A7&version=ESV), "I would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, â€˜You shall not covet,â€™" and [Romans 3:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A20&version=ESV) adds, "through the law comes knowledge of sin." 

Sin uses the law to stir desire, as [Romans 7:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7%3A8&version=ESV) states, "sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of covetousness," and [1 Corinthians 15:56](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+15%3A56&version=ESV) confirms, "the power of sin is the law." The law brought death, not life, for [Romans 7:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7%3A10&version=ESV) says, "the very commandment that promised life proved to be death to me," and [2 Corinthians 3:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+3%3A6&version=ESV) warns, "the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life." 

God gave us the world to enjoy, as [Genesis 1:31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A31&version=ESV) declares, "God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good," and [1 Timothy 6:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+6%3A17&version=ESV) says He "richly provides us with everything to enjoy." Jesus calls us to goodness in [Matthew 19:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+19%3A17&version=ESV), "there is only one who is good," and [Romans 12:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+12%3A2&version=ESV) urges, "be transformed by the renewal of your mind." Live kindly, as [Micah 6:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Micah+6%3A8&version=ESV) commands, "do justice, and to love kindness," and [Ephesians 4:32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+4%3A32&version=ESV) says, "be kind to one another, tenderhearted."

### Scriptural Witnesses
- **[Romans 7:7-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7%3A7-8&version=ESV)**: "I would not have known what sin was had it not been for the law... sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, produced in me every kind of coveting."
- **[Romans 6:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+6%3A14&version=ESV)**: "For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace."

## End of World Lesson

Godâ€™s people must endure, as [Revelation 13:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+13%3A10&version=ESV) calls, "Here is a call for the endurance and faith of the saints," and [Hebrews 10:36](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+10%3A36&version=ESV) says, "you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God you may receive what is promised." True love sacrifices, for [Romans 5:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A7&version=ESV) notes, "one will scarcely die for a righteous personâ€”though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die," and [John 15:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+15%3A13&version=ESV) declares, "greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends." 

Prophecy is worship, as [Revelation 19:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+19%3A10&version=ESV) states, "the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy," and [Revelation 12:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+12%3A17&version=ESV) describes those who "keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus." Deception rises, for [Revelation 17:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+17%3A2&version=ESV) says, "with her the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality," and [2 Thessalonians 2:9-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Thessalonians+2%3A9-10&version=ESV) warns of "the activity of Satan with all power and false signs and wonders." 

An image speaks, as [Revelation 13:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+13%3A15&version=ESV) reveals, "it was allowed to give breath to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast might even speak," and [Daniel 3:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+3%3A1&version=ESV) describes, "King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold." A beast falls and rises, for [Revelation 13:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+13%3A3&version=ESV) says, "one of its heads seemed to have a mortal wound, but its mortal wound was healed," and [Revelation 17:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+17%3A8&version=ESV) adds, "the beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to rise from the bottomless pit." The dragon empowers it, as [Revelation 13:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+13%3A2&version=ESV) states, "the dragon gave his power and his throne and great authority," and [Revelation 12:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+12%3A9&version=ESV) identifies, "that ancient serpent, who is called the devil and Satan." 

A second beast deceives, for [Revelation 13:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+13%3A14&version=ESV) says, "it deceives those who dwell on earth, telling them to make an image for the beast," and [2 Thessalonians 2:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Thessalonians+2%3A9&version=ESV) confirms, "with all wicked deception for those who are perishing." It forces a mark, as [Revelation 13:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+13%3A16&version=ESV) declares, "it causes allâ€¦ to be marked on the right hand or the forehead," and [Revelation 14:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+14%3A9&version=ESV) warns, "If anyone receives its mark on his forehead or on his hand." 

The Lord reigns, for [Revelation 10:1-3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+10%3A1-3&version=ESV) describes, "a mighty angelâ€¦ his voice was like the roar of seven thunders," and [Psalm 29:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+29%3A3&version=ESV) proclaims, "The voice of the Lord is over the waters; the God of glory thunders." Two witnesses rise, as [Revelation 11:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+11%3A3&version=ESV) promises, "I will grant authority to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for 1,260 days," and [Zechariah 4:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zechariah+4%3A14&version=ESV) identifies, "These are the two anointed ones who stand by the Lord of the whole earth." They wield power, for [Revelation 11:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+11%3A6&version=ESV) says, "They have the power to shut the sky, that no rain may fall," and [Exodus 7:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+7%3A20&version=ESV) recalls, "Mosesâ€¦ struck the waterâ€¦ and all the water turned to blood." 

The beast kills them, as [Revelation 11:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+11%3A7&version=ESV) states, "the beast that rises from the bottomless pit will make war on them and kill them," and [Daniel 7:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+7%3A21&version=ESV) warns, "that horn made war with the saints and prevailed over them." Yet they rise, for [Revelation 11:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+11%3A11&version=ESV) says, "the breath of life from God entered them, and they stood up," and [Ezekiel 37:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+37%3A5&version=ESV) promises, "Behold, I will cause breath to enter you, and you shall live." Gentiles trample, as [Revelation 11:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+11%3A2&version=ESV) foretells, "they will trample the holy city for forty-two months," and [Luke 21:24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+21%3A24&version=ESV) adds, "Jerusalem will be trampled underfoot by the Gentiles." 

Truth prevails, for [Proverbs 19:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+19%3A9&version=ESV) warns, "a false witness will not go unpunished," and [Revelation 21:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+21%3A8&version=ESV) condemns "all liarsâ€¦ their portion will be in the lake that burns." Be inscribed in life, as [Revelation 20:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+20%3A12&version=ESV) promises, "the book of life was opened," and [Revelation 3:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+3%3A5&version=ESV) assures, "I will never blot his name out of the book of life."
