# Imagining His Glory

The query invites us to imagine the glory of God, a concept deeply explored across the scriptures provided. God’s glory is a profound and multifaceted attribute, encompassing His majesty, holiness, power, and love, as revealed through creation, redemption, and His eternal presence. Let’s reflect on this glory through key themes drawn from the verses.

## The Majesty of God’s Creation

God’s glory shines through His creation, a testament to His infinite power and wisdom. [Genesis 1:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis 1:1) declares, “In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth,” setting the stage for His sovereign act of bringing all things into existence. [Psalm 19:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm 19:1) echoes this: “The heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky above proclaims his handiwork.” Imagine the vastness of the cosmos—stars, galaxies, and the intricate balance of nature—all crafted by His word ([Psalm 33:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm 33:6)). [Isaiah 40:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah 40:12) asks, “Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand and marked off the heavens with a span?” This imagery of God holding the universe in His hand invites us to marvel at a glory beyond comprehension.

## The Holiness That Sets Him Apart

God’s glory is inseparable from His holiness. [Psalm 99:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm 99:9) calls us to “worship at his holy mountain, for the Lord our God is holy.” This holiness is magnified in [Isaiah 6:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah 6:3), where the seraphim cry, “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!” The repetition underscores His utter uniqueness—no one compares to Him ([Isaiah 46:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah 46:9): “I am God, and there is none like me”). Picture a throne room filled with radiant light, where even celestial beings cover their faces in awe ([Revelation 4:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation 4:8)). His glory is a consuming fire ([Deuteronomy 4:24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy 4:24)), pure and unapproachable, yet drawing us to worship.

## The Power That Sustains and Redeems

God’s glory is not static; it is active in His power over all things. [Psalm 62:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm 62:11) affirms, “Power belongs to God,” and [Daniel 4:35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel 4:35) adds, “None can stay his hand.” Imagine the One who suspends the earth over nothing ([Job 26:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job 26:7)) and commands the seas ([Psalm 95:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm 95:5)), yet stoops to redeem humanity. [John 1:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John 1:14) reveals, “The Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory,” pointing to Jesus, the embodiment of God’s glory. His death and resurrection ([1 Corinthians 15:3-4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1 Corinthians 15:3-4)) display a glory that triumphs over sin and death, offering us eternal life ([Romans 6:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans 6:23)).

## The Love That Invites Us In

God’s glory is not distant; it is relational. [Psalm 145:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm 145:9) says, “The Lord is good to all, and his mercy is over all that he has made.” In [John 17:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John 17:23), Jesus prays that we “may become perfectly one” with Him and the Father, reflecting a glory that unites. Imagine being betrothed to Him forever ([Hosea 2:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hosea 2:19)), seeing His face ([Revelation 22:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation 22:4)), and dwelling in a city where “the glory of God gives it light” ([Revelation 21:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation 21:23)). His glory is a love that never fails ([Psalm 136:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm 136:1)), drawing us into eternal communion.

## A Glimpse of the Future Glory

Revelation paints the ultimate picture: a new heaven and earth where “the dwelling place of God is with man” ([Revelation 21:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation 21:3)). The New Jerusalem needs no sun, for “the Lord God will be their light” ([Revelation 22:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation 22:5)). Imagine a world without tears ([Revelation 21:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation 21:4)), where every nation worships the Lamb ([Revelation 7:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation 7:9)). His glory will be fully unveiled, and we will reign with Him ([Revelation 3:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation 3:21)), basking in a splendor words can scarcely capture.

## Can You Imagine?

To imagine His glory is to stand in awe of a God who creates with a whisper, reigns with unmatched power, and loves with an everlasting embrace. It’s the brilliance of the stars, the purity of His holiness, the strength of His redemption, and the intimacy of His presence—all converging in a vision that transcends our finite minds. As [Psalm 145:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm 145:3) proclaims, “Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised, and his greatness is unsearchable.” *Can you imagine? One day, we won’t just imagine—we’ll see Him face to face.*

### The Journey Begins: Creation and Promise
You begin with the genesis of all things:  
- **[Genesis 1:1 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A1&version=ESV):** "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth."  
This is the foundation—God’s sovereign power bringing existence into being. **[Hebrews 11:3 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+11%3A3&version=ESV)** echoes this: "By faith we understand that the universe was created by the word of God," and **[John 1:3 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A3&version=ESV)** reveals the agent: "All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made." Jesus, the Word, is God in action, co-creator with the Father.

- **[Genesis 1:26-28 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A26-28&version=ESV):** God says, "Let us make man in our image," blessing humanity with dominion. The plural "us" hints at the Trinity—Father, Son, and Spirit in unity (**[Psalm 8:6 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+8%3A6&version=ESV)** reinforces this stewardship). Here, we’re crafted for relationship with God, who is relational in His very being.

Then, the fall:  
- **[Genesis 3:6 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+3%3A6&version=ESV):** Adam and Eve’s disobedience ushers in sin (**[Romans 5:12 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A12&version=ESV):** "Sin came into the world through one man"). But hope emerges immediately in **[Genesis 3:15 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+3%3A15&version=ESV):** "He shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel." This protoevangelium points to Jesus, the offspring who crushes Satan (**[Romans 16:20 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+16%3A20&version=ESV)**). From the outset, God’s plan is redemption through His Son—who is God incarnate.

### The Path Forward: Covenant and Redemption
Your journey continues with God’s faithfulness:  
- **[Genesis 12:3 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+12%3A3&version=ESV):** "In you all the families of the earth shall be blessed." Through Abraham, God sets a covenantal trajectory toward global restoration, fulfilled in Christ (**[Galatians 3:8 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3%3A8&version=ESV):** "The Scripture… preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham"). Jesus is the blessing, God Himself fulfilling His promise.

- **[Exodus 20:2 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+20%3A2&version=ESV):** "I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of… slavery." The Exodus reveals God as Deliverer, codified in the Law (**[Exodus 20:1-17 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+20%3A1-17&version=ESV)**). **[Leviticus 19:2 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+19%3A2&version=ESV)** calls for holiness: "You shall be holy, for I the Lord your God am holy." This is God’s character, later embodied in Jesus, the Holy One (**[John 8:46 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+8%3A46&version=ESV)**).

- **[Isaiah 9:6 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+9%3A6&version=ESV):** "For to us a child is born… Mighty God, Everlasting Father." The prophet foresees the Messiah—Jesus, fully God, born as man (**[Luke 2:11 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+2%3A11&version=ESV)**). His titles affirm His deity, bridging the Old Testament promises to their New Testament reality.

### The Arrival: Christ, the Fulfillment
You proclaim, “Look where we’ve arrived!”—and indeed, we have:  
- **[John 1:14 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A14&version=ESV):** "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us." Jesus is God incarnate, Immanuel (**[Matthew 1:23 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+1%3A23&version=ESV):** "God with us"). His arrival is the pivot of history.

- **[John 3:16 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3%3A16&version=ESV):** "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son." This is the heart of the gospel—God’s love manifest in Jesus’ sacrifice (**[Romans 5:8 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A8&version=ESV):** "God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us"). Jesus is God giving Himself.

- **[1 Corinthians 15:3-4 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+15%3A3-4&version=ESV):** "Christ died for our sins… he was raised on the third day." The cross and resurrection fulfill Genesis 3:15, defeating death (**[Hebrews 2:14 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+2%3A14&version=ESV):** "That through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death"). Jesus, as God, conquers what we could not.

- **[John 14:6 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A6&version=ESV):** "I am the way, and the truth, and the life." Jesus doesn’t merely show the path; He is the path—God Himself reconciling us (**[Ephesians 2:18 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+2%3A18&version=ESV):** "Through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father"). His deity shines here: only God can be the way to God.

### Where We Stand Now: In Christ
You bring us to the present:  
- **[Romans 8:1 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A1&version=ESV):** "There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus." In Jesus, God justifies us, adopting us as children (**[Galatians 4:6 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+4%3A6&version=ESV):** "God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts"). This is our current arrival—freedom in Christ, who is God with us still.

- **[Ephesians 2:10 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+2%3A10&version=ESV):** "We are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works." Our purpose continues, reflecting God’s light (**[Matthew 5:16 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A16&version=ESV)**). Jesus, as God, recreates us in His image.

- The Spirit’s presence (**[1 Corinthians 3:16 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+3%3A16&version=ESV):** "You are God’s temple") empowers us (**[Acts 1:8 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+1%3A8&version=ESV)**), uniting us as one body (**[Ephesians 4:4-6 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+4%3A4-6&version=ESV)**). The Trinity—Father, Son, Spirit—works in harmony, and Jesus, God the Son, is central.

### The Final Arrival: A New Creation
You point us to the horizon:  
- **[Revelation 21:1 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+21%3A1&version=ESV):** "Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth." The journey culminates in restoration—no tears, no pain (**[Revelation 21:4 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+21%3A4&version=ESV)**). We’ll see His face (**[Revelation 22:4 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+22%3A4&version=ESV)**), and God will dwell with us (**[Revelation 21:3 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+21%3A3&version=ESV)**). Jesus, the Lamb, is this God (**[Revelation 22:3-4 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+22%3A3-4&version=ESV)**), reigning eternally.

- **[1 Corinthians 2:9 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+2%3A9&version=ESV):** "What no eye has seen, nor ear heard… God has prepared for those who love him." The future is beyond imagination, secured by Jesus, who is God.

### Can You See It?
Your words—“we’ve come so far… look where we’ve arrived”—mirror this biblical arc: from creation’s dawn, through sin’s shadow, to Christ’s light, and now on the cusp of eternity. Jesus is God—revealed as Creator (**[John 1:3 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A3&version=ESV)**), Redeemer (**[John 3:16 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3%3A16&version=ESV)**), and Returning King (**[Revelation 22:12 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+22%3A12&version=ESV)**). His deity ties every thread together:  
- He spoke the world into being (**[Genesis 1:1 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A1&version=ESV)**; **[John 1:1-3 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A1-3&version=ESV)**).  
- He entered it to save it (**[John 1:14 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A14&version=ESV)**; **[John 3:16 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3%3A16&version=ESV)**).  
- He’ll return to renew it (**[Revelation 21:5 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+21%3A5&version=ESV):** "Behold, I am making all things new").

My boi, your summation captures this truth: “His is God. Jesus is God.” We’ve arrived at His feet—redeemed, restored, rejoicing—and yet, the best is still ahead. Let’s keep looking, for “the Lord has brought us here, and He’s not done yet!”
